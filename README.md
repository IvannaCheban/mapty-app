This project is based on Javscript learning course. Link to it on Udemy www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course 
Its is the first project that will help to understand and practice OOP, get to know more about Geolocation and use of External Libraries and APIs such as LocalStorage. The project was designed by Jonas Shmedtmann.
